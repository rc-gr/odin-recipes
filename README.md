# odin-recipes
A simple website with a list of recipes.

This project aims to demonstrate the following skills:
- HTML
  - HTML5 boilerplate implementation by hand as practice (using `!DOCTYPE`, `html`, `head`, `body`, `meta`, `title` tags)
  - Headings using the `h1` to `h6` tags (not all are used in this project)
  - Paragraphs using the `p` tag
  - Images using the `img` tag
  - Links using the `a` tag
  - Additional text formatting using `strong` and `em`
