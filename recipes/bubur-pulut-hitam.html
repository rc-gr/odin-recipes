  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Bubur Pulut Hitam is a sweet porridge made from black glutinous rice. It is a popular dessert in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. A traditional recipe typically requires soaking the glutinous rice overnight (or a minimum of 4 hours), cooking the rice with water, sugar and pandan leaves for 1 hour. The dish is then served with thick coconut milk or coconut cream.</p>
  <p>For this recipe, however, a <em>pressure cooker</em> will be used. This will not only shorten the time required, but <strong>you don't have to constantly keep watch over it</strong>.</p>
